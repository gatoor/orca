Basics:
 -correct configuration on hosts
 -apps start on host
 -trainer Layout is updated properly
 -planning is working

Start:
 -aws instances are spawned
 -orca is installed there
 -started properly
 -checkin in trainer works


Running:
 -kill aws instance => new instance is spawned with appropriate config via timeout and event
 -kill host daemon => restarted by supervisor and loads last state properly
 -terminate host daemon => checkin timeout works
 -apps scale when response metric is too slow(NOT IMPLEMENTED)
 -scheduled scaling (SOME MISSING IMPLEMENTATION)

Changes in config:
 -update app
 -scale app manually
